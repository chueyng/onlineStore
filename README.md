#Backbonline Shop...

## Team
- Angie "the Boss"
- Sylvain "the Refugee"

## Problem
Create a fluid online shop to make faster online shopping

## Solution
Being able to build a Backbone online shop to challenge ourselves...

## Features
- User authentication and authorisation
- Shopping list
- Cart with instant update quantity/price/total amount
- stripe payment system

## Technologies used:
- Javascript
- Backbone.js
- Underscore.js
- jQuery
- Rails
- [Stripe Tutorial](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/guides/rails)
- Cloudinary for storing image

## Code
  **Routes**: Only the user sign in/up have been built with rails routes.
  **Schema**: 5 Tables organise the Database.

## Sore Bits
- Dreaming in code all week Again...
- `This`...(What's this??)
- `This.model` (Which model is this now?)
- `TotalAmount`
- Stripe in Backbone environment 

## Cool Beans
- Being confortable with templating
- pick a good syntax
- Project extensibility
- Working with The Boss
- Still does not understand what is `this` and when to use `that = this`  I do not want to know more about that, I mean this.
